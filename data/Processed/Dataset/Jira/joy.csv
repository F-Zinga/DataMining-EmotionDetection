"I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.";
"In my experience, this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.";
"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".";
"o Once you do that, you can get rid of the getUUID(), setUUID(), and getObjectID() methods in this class.";
"o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).";
"However, I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.";
"I think you are right to follow the existing patterns.";
"But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.";
"This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.";
"Don't worry, that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.";
"SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.";
"That is, the key order should be ( schemaID, sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName, schemaID ).";
"This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().";
"But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName, schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.";
"If so, then I would recommend adding a third index.";
"Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table.";
"See, for instance, the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory.";
"SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory, I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array, one cell for each column in the table.";
"DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.";
"EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String, TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface.";
"DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(), and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods, so they should be revised to describe the new methods.";
